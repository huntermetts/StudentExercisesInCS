Objective
The learning objective of this exercise is to practice creating instances of custom types that you defined with class, establishing the relationships between them, and practicing basic data structures in C#.

Once you have defined all of your custom types, go to your Main() method in Program.cs and implement the following logic.

Create 4, or more, exercises.
Create 3, or more, cohorts.
Create 4, or more, students and assign them to one of the cohorts.
Create 3, or more, instructors and assign them to one of the cohorts.
Have each instructor assign 2 exercises to each of the students.
